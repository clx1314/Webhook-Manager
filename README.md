## Frontend Functionality

The frontend of the webhook service is built using Svelte and provides a user-friendly interface for managing webhooks. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key functionalities:

### Features
1. **Create a Webhook**: Users can create new webhooks by filling out a form with the webhook's name, enable flag, and a list of URLs.
2. **View Existing Webhooks**: The application displays a list of all existing webhooks, showing their names and whether they are enabled or disabled.
3. **Trigger a Webhook**: Users can trigger a webhook to execute its configured URLs with optional data for token replacement.
4. **Error and Success Messages**: The UI provides feedback on the success or failure of operations, ensuring users are informed about the status of their actions.

### Operation Steps

#### 1. Create a Webhook
- **Navigate to the form**: On the main page, locate the "Manage Webhooks" section.
- **Fill in the details**:
  - **Webhook Name**: Enter a descriptive name for the webhook.
  - **Enable**: Check this box if you want the webhook to be active.
  - **URLs**: Enter one or more URLs separated by commas. You can use tokens in the format `{{token}}` for dynamic data replacement.
- **Submit the form**: Click the "Create Webhook" button. If successful, you will see a confirmation message and the new webhook will appear in the list below.

#### 2. View Existing Webhooks
- Below the creation form, you will see a list of existing webhooks.
- Each webhook entry displays:
  - **Name**: The name of the webhook.
  - **Status**: Indicates whether the webhook is enabled or disabled.
  - **Trigger Button**: A button next to each webhook allows you to trigger the webhook.

#### 3. Trigger a Webhook
- To trigger a webhook, click the "Trigger" button next to the desired webhook in the list.
- The application will send a request to the configured URLs, replacing any tokens with the data provided in the request. For example, if you have a URL like `http://example.com/webhook/{{token}}`, and the token is set to "12345", the request will go to `http://example.com/webhook/12345`.
- Upon success or failure, a message will be displayed informing you of the operation's status.

### Example Usage
1. Create a webhook with the name "My Webhook", enable it, and set the URL to `http://example.com/webhook/{{token}}`.
2. After creation, find "My Webhook" in the list.
3. Click "Trigger" to execute the webhook. You should see a success message if the request is processed correctly.

### Error Handling
- If there are issues while creating or triggering webhooks, error messages will appear on the screen, guiding you on what went wrong.
